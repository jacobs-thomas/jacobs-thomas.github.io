I'm Thomas Jacobs, a software engineer and computer scientist from Suffolk, United Kingdom. Surprisingly, my journey into Computer Science began in a less common field: Games Development. It all started with the University of The Arts London Games Development course, where I graduated with two distinctions before progression onto a Bachelor's degree with honours in Computer Games Programming. These programs taught me a firm understanding of fundamental programming and software engineering principles, much like any traditional computing curriculum. However, unlike many computer science courses, it was during this time that I discovered my somewhat niche passion for game engine and graphics programming, frequently working with C++, C, C#, and OpenGL.

Since pursuing my Master of Science degree in Computer Science, I have broadened my expertise across various software development environments and cultivated a strong interest in academic research, especially in software engineering and human-computer interaction. My technical toolkit now encompasses both front-end and back-end languages. For example, I develop websites and mobile applications using dynamic languages like Python and Kotlin while crafting physics engines and scripting API libraries with statically typed languages such as C and C++.
